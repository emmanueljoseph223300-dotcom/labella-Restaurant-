# La Bella — Restaurant Landing Page

This is a static, modern landing page for a restaurant. It includes a header that uses `images/logo.png` as the logo background, a hero, animated menu cards, and contact/reservation sections.

Quick preview (PowerShell):

```powershell
# from the project folder
Start-Process index.html
```

Files in this folder:
- `index.html` — main landing page
- `style.css` — styles, responsive layout, animations
- `script.js` — IntersectionObserver to animate cards
- `images/logo.png` — logo used as a background for the header
- `images/hero.svg` — decorative hero illustration (replaceable)

Notes:
- The menu cards use CSS + JS to slide into view with a staggered delay for a smooth modern feel.
- Replace `images/logo.png` with your official logo (square/rounded works best).
